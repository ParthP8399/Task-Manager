# üìñ Architecture
![High-Level Design (HLD) Diagram](https://github.com/ParthP8399/Task-Manager/blob/main/images/arch_diagram.png)
- Architecture Notes:
1. **Dependency Management & Cycle Prevention**
	- Dependencies are modeled as a directed graph using a junction table.
		```sql
		CREATE TABLE task_dependencies (
    	id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
   	 	task_id INTEGER,                -- The task that has a dependency
    	depends_on_task_id INTEGER,     -- The task it depends on
    	FOREIGN KEY (task_id) REFERENCES tasks(id),
    	FOREIGN KEY (depends_on_task_id) REFERENCES tasks(id),
    	UNIQUE (task_id, depends_on_task_id) -- Prevents duplicate links
		);
	- This structure allows a task to have multiple dependencies (e.g., Task C depends on Task A and Task B).

	- Cycle Detection Algorithm: Before adding a new dependency (POST /api/tasks/:id/dependencies), the backend checks if it would create a circular dependency (e.g., A ‚Üí B ‚Üí A). This is critical to prevent 				deadlocks where tasks can never be completed.
	- Algorithm Used: Depth-First Search (DFS)

	- Implementation: The createsCycle(task_id, depends_on_task_id) function:

	- Builds an adjacency list representation of the entire current dependency graph.

	- Initiates a DFS starting from the proposed new dependency (depends_on_task_id).
	- Searches for a path back to the original task (task_id).
	- If a path is found, the request is rejected with a 400 Bad Request error, preventing the cycle.

2. **State Transition Validation**
	- Task status changes (PUT /api/tasks/:id/status) are not simple updates; they are state transitions governed by strict business rules.
	- Validation Rules: The backend enforces a state machine to ensure logical progression:
	- To in-progress:
		- Prerequisite: All of the task's dependencies must have a done status.
		- Logic: The API queries all dependencies and filters for incomplete ones. If any are found, the transition is blocked, and the list of blocking tasks is returned to the client.

	- To done:
		- Prerequisite 1: The task must currently be in the in-progress state. This prevents jumping directly from todo to done.
		- Prerequisite 2: (Redundant safety check) All dependencies must be done.

	- Logic: This two-step rule ensures tasks are worked on and provides a final check before completion.

	- Normalization:
		- The normalizeStatus(s) helper function ensures robust comparisons by converting various user inputs ('completed', 'Complete', 'in progress') into three canonical states: todo, in-progress, done.

3. **Critical Path Analysis**
	- The GET /api/projects/:id/critical-path endpoint calculates the longest path of dependent tasks within a project, which determines the project's minimum possible completion time.
	- Algorithm Used: Depth-First Search (DFS) with Memoization

4. **Safe Deletion Handling**
	- The DELETE /api/tasks/:id endpoint implements a confirmation mechanism for tasks that have dependents.
	- Check: Before deletion, it queries for any other tasks that depend on the task-to-be-deleted.
	- Force Flag: If dependents are found, the deletion is aborted unless the ?force=true query parameter is provided. This explicit "force" flag requires the client to acknowledge the potentially breaking 							change.
	- Cascading Deletes: When a task is deleted (forced or not), all its associated dependency records are also removed to maintain referential integrity

#  AI Usage Details
	- Used AI tools to assist with frontend implementation (UI structure and styling suggestions).
 	- Leveraged AI for debugging support and resolving  errors.
  	- Referred to AI for syntax corrections and code snippets to speed up development.
